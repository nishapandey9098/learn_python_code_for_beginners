# learn_python_code_for_beginners
It contains basic python learning codes including the class, objects, inheritance, for loop, while loop, if statements etc., for beginners with few examples.
Welcome to my collection of Python beginner projects! 
This repository contains all the exercises, mini-projects, and practice scripts I completed while following the Python Full Course for Beginners (freeCodeCamp).

The goal of this repo is to practice Python fundamentals, showcase clean code, and build a solid foundation for automation, data handling, and problem-solving.


> What’s Inside

The repository is organized by topics covered in the course:

🔹 Basics → variables, data types, strings, numbers, operators

🔹 Control Flow → if/else, loops, logical operations

🔹 Functions → reusable code blocks, arguments, return values

🔹 Data Structures → lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries

🔹 File Handling → reading/writing files, working with text

🔹 Modules & Libraries → importing Python libraries

🔹 Error Handling → try/except, raising exceptions

🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) → classes, objects, inheritance

🔹 Mini-Projects → calculators, guessing games, file operations, etc.

> Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Built-in libraries (os, math, etc.)
Text editor: VS Code

> Sample Mini Projects

📝 Calculator → performs basic math operations.

🎲 Number Guessing Game → simple CLI game using random numbers.

📁 File Renamer → renames multiple files in a folder.

📊 Word Counter → counts words in a text file.

✅ To-Do List (CLI) → manage daily tasks via terminal.

> How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>


Run a Python script:
python mini_projects/calculator.py


> Learning Outcomes

By completing this course and projects, I gained experience in:

Writing clean & modular Python code.

Understanding core programming concepts.

Building small but useful automation scripts.

Using Git/GitHub for version control.


 > Future Work

Add automation projects (file organizer, Excel cleaner).

Explore web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Requests).

Build GUI apps using Tkinter.
